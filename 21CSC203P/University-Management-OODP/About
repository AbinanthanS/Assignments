COMPARISION OF DESIGN ,EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTAINABILITY

1. DESIGN:

      Object-Oriented Design:

        > Encapsulation: Data and methods are bundled together, allowing for better data hiding.
        > Abstraction: OOP allows for the creation of abstract data types, making the code easier to understand at a higher level.
        > Inheritance and Polymorphism: Facilitates code reuse and flexibility, allowing new classes to extend existing ones.

     Procedural Design:

        > Linear Structure: Functions operate on global data, making it less organized.
        > No Encapsulation: Data and functions are separate, leading to potential data integrity issues.
        > Less Abstraction: Each function must handle its own logic without the benefit of class structures.

2. EASE OF USE:

    Object-Oriented:

      > Intuitive: The class structure often makes it easier to understand relationships and interactions.
      > Modular: Easier to break down complex systems into manageable components.

    Procedural:

      > Simplicity: For small programs, a procedural approach may be easier to grasp and implement quickly.
      > Less Overhead: Fewer constructs (like classes) can lead to a more straightforward implementation for simple tasks.

3. COMPATIBILITY:

     Object-Oriented:

       > Better for Large Systems: OOP can handle larger systems more effectively due to modularity and encapsulation.
       > Interoperability: Easier to integrate with other OOP languages and systems.

     Procedural:

       > Quick Prototyping: Suitable for scripting and quick prototypes where complex structures are unnecessary.
       > Legacy Systems: Many older systems are procedural, making it easier to integrate with existing procedural codebases.

4. OMPLEMENTATION:

     Object-Oriented:

       > More Setup Required: Classes, methods, and constructors can require more initial setup.
       > State Management: Objects can maintain state more easily across different functions.

     Procedural:

      > Less Overhead: Requires less boilerplate code, leading to faster initial implementation.
      > Direct Manipulation: Functions can directly manipulate global data, which can simplify some tasks.
5. MAINTAINABILITY:

    Object-Oriented:

      > Easier to Maintain: Changes to one part of the code can often be isolated within a class.
      > Code Reuse: Inheritance and polymorphism enable reuse of existing code, reducing redundancy.
    
    Procedural:

      > Tight Coupling: Changes in one function may require changes across multiple areas, increasing the risk of bugs.
      > Difficult to Scale: As the codebase grows, managing and updating procedural code can become cumbersome.

OVERALL : 
Design: OOP provides a more structured approach, while procedural is simpler for small tasks.
Ease of Use: OOP can be more intuitive for complex applications, while procedural is straightforward for quick scripts.
Compatibility: OOP is better for large systems and modern integrations; procedural is good for legacy systems.
Implementation: OOP may require more initial setup; procedural allows for quick coding.
Maintainability: OOP generally leads to better long-term maintenance; procedural can become challenging as complexity increases.
